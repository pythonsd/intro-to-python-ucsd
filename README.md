slide deck for intro to python tutorial presented at ucsd (Natan)

This is the slide deck for a class I will be teaching at UCSD.  I am happy to share it with the Python Users Group. It is based partially on the users group tutorial, as well as several other courses.  

The audience will be 70 undergraduate students and each class is a total of 4 hours long.  For this reason, many topics are not covered (sets, list comprehensions, mutability, tuples, etc.).

If anyone has any comments or suggestions, please let me know!

Thanks!
Natan Jacobson
